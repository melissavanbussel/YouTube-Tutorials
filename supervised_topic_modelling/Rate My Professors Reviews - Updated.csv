9310,Wolfgang Koerner,University of Ottawa,Political Science department,3,3,AVERAGE,POL3162,His lectures tend to be extremely dry & boring but his dry humor and his tendency to have shorter lectures can make his lectures easier to deal with. He is a very interesting & knowledgeable person. There are some inconsistencies in grading on papers but that might be the T.A. You can easily get C+ to a B+ with minimal effort,0,0,"Jun 19th, 2020"
